# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with sample values
# for development and staging environments.
#
# Data required for production should go into a database migration.

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
